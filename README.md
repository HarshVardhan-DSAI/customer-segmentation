##  **Method**
- Data exploration and cleaning
- Applied **K-Means clustering** to segment customers
- Used the **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters
- Visualized clusters using scatter plots to understand customer groups

---

##  **Results**
- Identified **5 distinct customer segments**, including:
  - High-income, high-spending customers
  - Low-income, low-spending customers
  - Moderate-income customers with varying spending habits
- Clusters help the business understand and target each group differently:
  - Reward loyal high spenders
  - Create offers for low-spending customers to increase engagement
